  <h1>Hi, I'm hollie.</h1>

  <p>
    I'm a recent graduate of <a target="_blank" href="https://bath.ac.uk">Bath Uni</a>, achieving a 1st in Computer Science.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm now working at <a target="_blank" href="https://mayden.co.uk">Mayden</a>, a Bath-based healthcare IT company, as a software developer. I work on iaptus, a web-based patient management system for psycological therapists which is widely used by the NHS anh also in the private sector. I like front end development best, but I also enjoy the variety of diagnosing and fixing issues while on support.

  <p>
    I love to learn new things, and like to experiment with new technologies in my spare time, along with crocheting cute amigurumi animals.
